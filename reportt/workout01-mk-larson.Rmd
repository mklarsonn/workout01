#My own index which I will use to calculate the rankings is something I call rebounding skills. It ranks them by the total rebounds (off_rebounds + def_rebounds). As someone who grew up playing basketball, I know how important rebounds are to a team seeing success. 

ranks_rebounds <- ggplot(data = teams) +aes(reorder(x = teams$team, teams$total_rebounds), y = teams$total_rebounds) + geom_bar(stat = 'identity') + labs(x = "Team", y = "total rebounds", title = "Nba teams ranked by total rebounds skills") + coord_flip() + geom_vline(xintercept = mean(teams$total_rebounds), color = "blue")

## Comments and Reflections
* This was indeed my first time working with a file of such structure. It was a little bit difficult to get the hang of at first, but eventually I understood.
* This was not my first time using relative paths, I have done so in CS61A
* This was my first time using an R script
* I really enjoyed just writing code over having to include markdown syntax
* This was not easy, especially since we haven't done anything this complex in lab or lecture
* No one helped me complete the assignment
* This homework took over 6 hours to complete
* The most time consuming part was getting everything in the right path, and in github
* I did enjoy learning more about github and how helpful it can be

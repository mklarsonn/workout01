Peach Butter Recipe
-------------------

### Ingredients

-   4 Pounds of Peaches
-   1 Cup of Water
-   2 Cups of Granulated Sugar
-   Juice of 1 Lemon

#### Special Kitchen Tools Needed

-   Food Mill
-   Large Pot
-   Cans

Instructions
------------

To make this Peach Butter, it involves some simple steps. First, cut the peaches in half and remove the pits. From there, place the cut peaches and the water into a large pot and bring it to a boil for about 20 minutes.

**This is where having a food mill comes into play. Once boiling, run the peaches through the food mill and remove the skins.**

Place the pureed peaches back in the pot and add the sugar and lemon juice. Leave this mixure boiling for about 30 minutes, and voila you have peach butter!!!

*Variations of the Recipe include replacing the peaches with Nectarines, Plums, or any kind of similar summer fruit!!! We all know how yummy these fruit types are in the peak of summer between June and August!*

Quadratic Equation
------------------

*a**x*<sup>2</sup> + *b**x* + *c* = 0

-   The quadratic equation is a form where x represents an unknown, and a,b,c represent known number where a != 0. The equation describes a function with two roots.

### The Formula to find the roots of a Quadratic Equation

$x=(-b+-\\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac})/2a$

#### The Derivation of the Solution

*a**x*<sup>2</sup> + *b**x* + *c* = 0
4*a*<sup>2</sup>*x*<sup>2</sup> + 4*a**b**x* + 4*a**c* = 0
4*a*<sup>2</sup>*x*<sup>2</sup> + 4*a**b**x* = −4*a**c*
4*a*<sup>2</sup>*x*<sup>2</sup> + 4*a**b**x* + *b*<sup>2</sup> = *b*<sup>2</sup> − 4*a**c*
(2*a**x* + *b*)<sup>2</sup> = *b*<sup>2</sup> − 4*a**c*
$2ax+b=+-\\sqrt(b^{2}-4ac)$
$2ax=-b+-\\sqrt(b^{2}-4ac)$
$x=(-b+-\\sqrt(b^{2}-4ac))/2a$

Comments And Reflections
------------------------

What I found hardest with this project was ismply learning the latex notation for all the Math Symbols.
This was decently easy even though we haven't done it in class, the directions were well explained.
This was the first time that I myself had ever created a markdown. The only help I used to complete the assignment was just looking up some of the syntax online, as well as asking questions of my peers.
This homework assignment took me around two hours, and the most time consuming part was ensuring that I saved the file correctly as well as submitted it correctly.
